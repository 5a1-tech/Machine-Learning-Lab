# List of Experiments
1. The probability that it is Friday and that a student is absent is 3 %. Since there are 5 school
days in a week, the probability that it is Friday is 20 %. What is theprobability that a student is
absent given that today is Friday? Apply Baye’s rule in python to get the result. (Ans: 15%)
 2. Extract the data from database using python
 3. Implement k-nearest neighbours classification using python
 4. Given the following data, which specify classifications for nine combinations of VAR1 and VAR2
predict a classification for a case where VAR1=0.906 and VAR2=0.606, using the result of kmeans clustering with 3 means (i.e., 3 centroids)
 VAR1 VAR2 CLASS
 1.713 1.586 0
 0.180 1.786 1
 0.353 1.240 1
 0.940 1.566 0
 1.486 0.759 1
 1.266 1.106 0
 1.540 0.419 1
 0.459 1.799 1
 0.773 0.186 1
 5. The following training examples map descriptions of individuals onto high, medium and low
credit-worthiness.
 medium skiing design single twenties no -> highRisk
 high golf trading married forties yes -> lowRisk
 low speedway transport married thirties yes -> medRisk
 medium football banking single thirties yes -> lowRisk
 high flying media married fifties yes -> highRisk
 low football security single twenties no -> medRisk
 medium golf media single thirties yes -> medRisk
 medium golf transport married forties yes -> lowRisk
 high skiing banking single thirties yes -> highRisk
 low golf unemployed married forties yes -> highRisk
 Input attributes are (from left to right) income, recreation, job, status, age-group, home-owner. Find the
unconditional probability of `golf' and the conditional probability of `single' given `medRisk' in the
dataset?
 6. Implement linear regression using python.
 7. Implement Naïve Bayes theorem to classify the English text
 8. Implement an algorithm to demonstrate the significance of genetic algorithm
 9. Implement the finite words classification system using Back-propagation algorithm
